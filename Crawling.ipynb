The program of learning embraces not only the esoteric theory and concepts embodied in the Talmud and the practical Halachic (legal) principles that are derived from the Talmud, but also the Torah Hashkafa, or ethical and moral values and imperatives critical to individual and interpersonal growth.  Consequently, an important part of the student's Torah education involves the study of middos, or character development, with an emphasis on caring for another's well-being.\n",

One of the underlying principles defining the mission of Beis Medrash Heichal Dovid is fusing Torah learning with acts of kindness. Nowhere is this illustrated better than by the Rosh HaYeshiva, Rabbi Yaakov Bender. Rabbi Bender delivers a lecture to youngsters in preschool, then to boys in the elementary school, junior high, high school and finally the Beis Medrash. Each hears the same basic lesson presented on a different level. The point is to educate students on proper character traits and infuse them with the concept of assisting others. Kind acts can occur through the Gemara. It is one thing to ‘preach’ kindness, in this Yeshiva; we ‘act’ on it.\n",

It seeks to liberate and nurture the individuality, the creative intelligence, and the ethical and aesthetic sensibility of its students, to the end that their richly varied natural endowments will be directed toward self-fulfillment and toward constructive social purposes. We believe that these educational goals are best served by demanding of our students active participation in the planning of their own programs, and in the regulation of their own lives on campus. Student freedom is not the absence of restraint, however; it is rather the fullest possible substitution of habits of self-restraint for restraint imposed by others. The exercise of student freedom is the very condition of a meaningful education, and an essential aspect of the nurture of free citizens, dedicated to civilized values and capable of creative and constructive membership in modern society.\n",

The centrality of Torah study as the sine qua non of the Jewish experience is the underlying tenet on which the Shaarei Yosher education program is predicated. Mastery of the Talmud in a yeshiva setting has been widely accepted as the preferred method for the development of an accomplished Talmid Chacham, a Jewish scholar of stature. Intense study of the Talmud and its commentaries is the primary goal of the academic programs at Beth Hamedrash Shaarei Yosher Institute. Beth Hamedrash Shaarei Yosher Institute seeks to inculcate its students with a broad understanding of Talmudic knowledge as well as the analytical skills needed to plunge the depths of Torah scholarship.  A student at Beth Hamedrash Shaarei Yosher Institute is expected to immerse himself into the depth of Torah learning, with an emphasis on the Talmud. He is further expected to demonstrate a personal commitment to Torah study, which will result in a lifelong pursuit of Torah learning. The emphasis of the academic program on Talmudic study requires students to spend a major portion of their day engrossed in the study of the Talmud. In addition to the student's intellectual growth as a scholar, Beth Hamedrash Shaarei Yosher Institute also focuses on his moral and ethical development. To this end, Beth Hamedrash Shaarei Yosher Institute promotes the study of Mussar, or Ethics, based on the Aggadic sections of the Talmud, as well as classical literature of the last several hundred years exploring the philosophical and moral imperatives in ethical human behavior.\n",

As a research university, Brandeis is dedicated to the advancement of the humanities, arts and social, natural and physical sciences. As a liberal arts college, Brandeis affirms the importance of a broad and critical education in enriching the lives of students and preparing them for full participation in a changing society, capable of promoting their own welfare, yet remaining deeply concerned about the welfare of others.  In a world of challenging social and technological transformations, Brandeis remains a center of open inquiry and teaching, cherishing its independence from any doctrine or government. It strives to reflect the heterogeneity of the United States and of the world community whose ideas and concerns it shares. In the belief that the most important learning derives from the personal encounter and joint work of teacher and students, Brandeis encourages undergraduates and postgraduates to participate with distinguished faculty in research, scholarship and artistic activities.  Brandeis was founded in 1948 as a nonsectarian university under the sponsorship of the American Jewish community to embody its highest ethical and cultural values and to express its gratitude to the United States through the traditional Jewish commitment to education. By being a nonsectarian university that welcomes students, teachers and staff of every nationality, religion and orientation, Brandeis renews the American heritage of cultural diversity, equal access to opportunity and freedom of expression.  The university that carries the name of the justice who stood for the rights of individuals must be distinguished by academic excellence, by truth pursued wherever it may lead and by awareness of the power and responsibilities that come with knowledge.\n",

For the most gifted students, this means helping them become genuine Torah scholars who are not only capable of mastering the individual Mesachtas included in the curriculum, but also of joining the community of scholars who are solely devoted to Torah learning. For those who are not so inclined, the program aims to equip them with the requisite logical and analytical skills for lifelong and independent learning, with an appreciation of the singular importance of Talmudic study.    Another component of the mission is to provide the training needed to live a Torah life. This includes the study of important Mussar and ethical texts as well as providing students with appropriate role models drawn from both historical and contemporary personalities. It also involves exposing students to the important literature on basic Halacha that defines the parameters of Mitzvos Ma’sios, the ritual practices of Judaism.\n",

In line with Chabad philosophy, Central Yeshiva Tomchei Tmimim Lubavitz also aims to concern itself with serving the spiritual needs of world Jewry and supplying even the remotest communities with their need for religious functionaries and communal workers.  Integral to these general goals is that all graduates be well acquainted with the unique Chabad perspective on all aspects of life. A major gauge of success is whether graduates of Central Yeshiva Tomchei Tmimim Lubavitz adopt this perspective in their lives to the extent that they dedicate their lives and careers to pursue its objective.  As Chabad yeshivos have proliferated, Central Yeshiva Tomchei Tmimim Lubavitz has come to view its role in the educational process as the final preparation of students for graduate school and for eventually stepping into the world as community workers for the Jewish public\n",
